# Adapting Image Outpainting for Unbounded Two-Dimensional Landmass Generation

Robathan Harries

## Stanford CS-230 Course Project

For this course project, I used a combination of Encoder-Decoders and Generative Adversarial Networks to procedurally generate world-spanning heightmaps without fixed boundaries. The final model (though others were tested) implements the NS-Outpaint Architecture (Yang et al, 2019), and adapts it to allow long-distance 2D image generation.

I've included in this repository both my final project report and the associated short presentation recording.

### 1D Tile Generation

In the following image, the left half is a true heightmap tile, and the right half is generated.

### Long-Distance 1D Tile Generation

The following images contain 5 tiles stitched together horizontally. The leftmost tile is real, and the four following tiles are sequentially generated.

### 2D Tile Generation

The following images contain 1 true heightmap tile (bottom left), and 3 generated tiles. The 2 generated tiles directly adjacent to the original tile were generated using the original NS-Outpaint architecture.
The top-right tile (since it needed to be consistent with two adjacent tiles) was generated using a fine-tuned adaptation of NS-Outpaint to the 2D generation case.

### Long-Distance 2D Tile Generation

In the following images (17x7 tiles), only the bottom-left tile contains true heightmap data. The remaining tiles are all generated by the model.
